# Vibe Tech CRM - Official Website

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the official website of **Vibe Tech CRM**. The website aims to introduce Vibe Tech, showcase its features and benefits, and provide a point of contact for interested users.

The design and feel of this website are inspired by a modern, clean, and professional aesthetic, similar to the "TECH VIBE" style, featuring a dark theme with vibrant accents.

## Design Inspiration

The primary visual inspiration for this website is the "TECH VIBE" design, characterized by:
*   Dark, professional theme
*   Bold, clean typography
*   Clear calls-to-action
*   Structured layout with dedicated sections (Hero, About, Services/Features, Contact)
*   Engaging use of icons and imagery

Our goal is to adapt this style to represent the Vibe Tech CRM brand effectively.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For any client-side interactivity (e.g., mobile navigation, simple animations).
*   **(Potentially) Third-party libraries/services:** For features like contact forms, if needed.
